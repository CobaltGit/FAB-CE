  <h1>About </h1>
  <p> FAB-CE is an open source version of Frontier Administration Bot that contains the same functionality as the original but with all TMAFE-specific related commands/events removed. </p>
  <h1>Configuration </h1>
 <p> To configure stuff such as the bot owner, client ID, and token, edit the "settings.json" inside of the data folder. </p>
<h1>Opening in Discord Bot Maker </h1>
  <p> To open the bot in DBM, you must create an empty "project.discordbot" file inside of the FAB CE folder and open it from DBM.
  <h1> How do I get it running? </h1>
  Open a terminal inside the folder and do "node bot.js". The bot should start up afterwards. Alternatively, you can run it with DBM.
